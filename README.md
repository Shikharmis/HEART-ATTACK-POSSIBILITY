# Heart-Attack-Possibility
The goal is to be able to accurately classify as having or not having heart disease based on diagnostic test data.


In this heat attack Prediction: On the basis of past diagnostic test data of several patients, creating models for predicting the chances of having a heart attack in near future.

About dataset:

Age, Sex CPT=Chest pain type RBP=Resting blood pressure Cholestoral FBS=Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl RER=Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) MAX.HR=Maximum heart rate achieved Exercise induced angina Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest Slope of the peak exercise ST segment Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy Thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect Target:- Target: 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack

I have compared multiple models like LR, DT, RF, KNN, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes and concluded that SVM and DT give the best accuracy.
